# graphterglow

A minimal Clojure library for drawing graphs of the behavior of
various objects in
[Afterglow](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow). It was originally
developed to help document
[Step Parameters](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/parameters.adoc#step-parameters)
but can be quite useful in testing and debugging oscillators and other
variable parameters.

## Usage

Look at the code in `src/graphterglow/core.clj` and the
[Incanter documentation](https://github.com/incanter/incanter) to
learn how to make graphs.
